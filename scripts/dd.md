Create a **design document** of this system/feature stating all critical design decisions, tradeoffs, components, services, and communications. Also specify how your system handles at scale, and what will eventually become a chokepoint.

Do **not** create unnecessary components, just to make design look complicated. A good design is **always simple and elegant**. A good way to think about it is if you were to create a separate process/machine/infra for each component and you will have to code it yourself, would you still do it?
